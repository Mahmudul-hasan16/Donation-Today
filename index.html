                    “Kindness is giving hope to those who think they are all alone in this world.” “Kindness is seeing
                    the
                    best
                    in others when they cannot see it in themselves.” “Kindness is something anyone can give without
                    losing
                    anything themselves.” “Kindness is not what you do, but who you are.”
